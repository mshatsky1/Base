# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! This repository is a playground
for clean Git workflows, so please emphasize clarity and tiny commits.

## Workflow

1. Create a branch describing the change.
2. Add focused commits that each capture one idea.
3. Open a pull request with a short summary and testing notes (if any).

## Style

- Prefer Markdown for prose.
- Keep scripts POSIX-compatible when practical.
- Document every new file in the README or related docs.
