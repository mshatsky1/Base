# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Markdown linting fails

If `scripts/check.sh` reports errors:
- Install markdownlint: `npm install -g markdownlint-cli`
- Or skip the check if not needed

### Git hooks not working

This repository doesn't include git hooks by default. Add them if needed for your workflow.

### Documentation links broken

Use `scripts/check.sh` to validate markdown, or manually verify all internal links.
