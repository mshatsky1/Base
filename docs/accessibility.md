# Accessibility

## Guidelines

This repository aims to maintain accessible documentation:

- Use semantic markdown structure
- Provide alt text for images (when added)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Write clear, descriptive link text

## Standards

- Follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA where applicable
- Test with screen readers if possible
- Keep language clear and concise

## Future

As the repository grows, accessibility checks can be automated in CI.
