# Performance

## Considerations

Since this repository focuses on documentation rather than code execution:

- **File size**: Keep documentation files reasonably sized
- **Link checking**: Validate internal links don't create circular references
- **Markdown rendering**: Use standard markdown for fast rendering

## Optimization

- Avoid embedding large images directly
- Use relative links for internal references
- Keep scripts lightweight and focused

## Metrics

No performance metrics are currently tracked, but this can be added if needed.
