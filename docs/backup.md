# Backup

## Strategy

This repository is hosted on GitHub, which provides:

- Automatic redundancy
- Version history in git
- Remote backup via cloning

## Local Backups

For additional safety:

- Clone the repository to multiple locations
- Use git's distributed nature for redundancy
- Keep local copies of important documentation

## Recovery

If data is lost:

- Restore from GitHub
- Use git history to recover previous versions
- Check local clones if available
