# Architecture Decision Records

This document tracks important architectural and design decisions.

## ADR-001: Minimal Repository Structure

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-11-25

We maintain a flat, simple directory structure to reduce cognitive overhead and make the repository easy to navigate. This approach prioritizes clarity over hierarchical organization.

## ADR-002: Small, Incremental Commits

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-11-25

We prefer many small, focused commits over large monolithic changes. This makes review easier, history more readable, and rollbacks more precise.

## ADR-003: Documentation-First Approach

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-11-25

We prioritize comprehensive documentation over code. This ensures the repository remains accessible and maintainable, with clear guidance for contributors and users.
