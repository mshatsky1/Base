# Deployment

## Overview

This repository is primarily documentation-focused and doesn't require traditional deployment.

## Considerations

- Documentation changes are immediately visible after merge
- No build process or compilation step
- GitHub Pages can be enabled for rendered documentation if desired

## Future

If automation or tooling is added, deployment procedures will be documented here.
