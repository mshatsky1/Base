# Scaling

## Current Approach

This repository is designed to scale horizontally through:

- Modular documentation structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy addition of new sections

## Growth Strategy

As the repository grows:

- Maintain clear directory structure
- Keep files focused and reasonably sized
- Use cross-references to avoid duplication

## Limits

No hard limits are enforced, but best practices include:

- Keep individual files under 1000 lines
- Use subdirectories for organization
- Regular cleanup of outdated content
