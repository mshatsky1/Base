# Core Values

1. **Clarity** – every file should explain itself or link to supporting docs.
2. **Iteration** – prefer small, reversible changes over sweeping rewrites.
3. **Documentation** – write down decisions so future contributors can ramp quickly.
4. **Automation** – scripts and CI exist to reduce manual steps.
5. **Respect** – collaboration stays constructive and kind.
