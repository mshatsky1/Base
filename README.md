Base
====

This repository is intentionally minimal and serves as a sandbox for
lightweight Git workflows.

## Contents

- `Base`: placeholder file keeping the repository non-empty.
- `docs/`: project intent, mission, roadmap, FAQ, style guide, architecture, glossary, decision records, process, and values.
- `notes/`: scratchpad and TODO lists for future exploration.
- `scripts/`: automation scripts for bootstrap, setup, check, and cleanup.
- `.github/`: issue and PR templates, CI workflows.

## Getting Started

There are no build steps or runtime requirements. Clone the repository,
run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (optional), and begin experimenting with
version control.

## Contributing

Please keep contributions small, easy to review, and well described in
their commit messages. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the agreed workflow.
